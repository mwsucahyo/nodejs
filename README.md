# What is Node js

## Node.js is JavaScript

Node.js is a runtime for built on top of Chrome's V8. It allows you to develop apps in JavaScript outside of the browser. It's single threaded non blocking and asynchronous. This is acheived by the use of an event loop at the core of Node.js. If you know JS then you already know how to develop with Node.js, kinda....
## Use cases
Because Node.js can run outside of the browser, it can be used for pretty much anything!

- Databases (yes some DB's are built in Node)
- CLI's
- Build Tools
- Automations
- Basic Scripting
- GPU shopping bots ðŸ‘€
